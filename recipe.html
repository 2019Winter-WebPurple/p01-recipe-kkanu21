            <li>1/2 cup of butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chip</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Directions!</h2>
        <ol><!--this is an ordered list of directions to follow to prepare the cookies-->
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
            <li>Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix butter with the sugars until well-combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Please read the recipe note about properly measuring flour.</li>
            <li>Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.</li>
            <li>Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough (medium cookie scoop) and place on baking sheet</li>
            <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p><!--extra recipe notes to follow-->
            Be sure to fluff and then scoop and sweep to measure the flour, and don't over-bake the cookies!</p>
